max capacities:
Jug 1 = 8 lit
Jug 2 = 5 lit
Jug 3 = 3 lit

initial state = 8 0 0
goal state = 4 4 0

steps:
1. 8 0 0
2. 3 5 0
3. 3 2 3
4. 6 2 0
5. 6 0 2
6. 1 5 2
7. 1 4 3
8. 4 4 0



-- This is Three Jug Problem --
// Here we have to return number of moves it took to solve the problem and
// if inputs of problem are invalid to solve we have to return
// "not possible" before proceeding

[hint: use BFS(implement using queue data structure)]


-- Key BFS Idea --
Each state = (a, b, c)
From a state, we can pour water from one jug to another
BFS guarantees minimum number of moves
Use a visited set to avoid infinite loops

-- Invalid / Not Possible Conditions --
Return "not possible" if:
1. Any goal jug > its capacity
2. Total water in goal ≠ total water in initial
3. BFS exhausts all states without reaching goal
